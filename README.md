# Assignment 5: Smart Contracts I

## Problem Statement
Create and deploy a smart contract that stores two variables, A and B, and emits their:
- Sum
- Difference
- Product
- Quotient

Additionally, emit the stored variables after they are initialized or updated.

## Features of the Contract
- **Constructor**: Initializes the variables A and B.
- **Getters and Setters**: Allows for retrieving and updating variables.
- **Separate Functions for Operations**: Each operation (sum, difference, product, quotient) is implemented in a separate function that emits the result.

## Deployment Steps
1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Copy the Solidity code into a new file.
3. Compile the contract.
4. Deploy the contract using MetaMask.
5. Interact with the contract to trigger events.

## Deliverables
- Solidity file (`Assignment5.sol`)
- Screenshots of:
  - Contract deployment on Remix IDE
  - Contract deployed and interacted with on MetaMask
